# RailsCalendar
Welcome to RailsCalendar! This is a simple calendar app that allows users to add events to a personal calendar.
RailsCalendar was built in Ruby on Rails and was created as part of the Ada Developers Academy program and is available on the web at this-is-a-calendar.herokuapp.com.

##Installation
1. Clone to your local machine using the SSH URL git@github.com:brittanykohler/RailsCalendar.git
2. Run `bundle install` to install gems
3. Run `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` for seed data

##Future Improvements
Please consider contributing to RailsCalendar to improve the functionality and design. Below are suggested improvements and features to be developed.

* Adding user authentication
* Adding rspec tests
* Updating the calendar page to show events in chronological order on each day
* Allowing users to create shared calendars
* Allowing a user to view a calendar by day, week, or month
* Updating the design on the event input page
* Adding end date/time for events
* Updating calendar add event functionality - perhaps the entire cell could be a link to add an event
